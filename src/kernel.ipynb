    "## Simple Tutorial to Understand How Autoencoders work\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are a special type of neural network architectures in which the output is same as the input. Autoencoders are trained in an unsupervised manner in order to learn the exteremely low level repersentations of the input data. These low level features are then deformed back to project the actual data. An autoencoder is a regression task where the network is asked to predict its input (in other words, model the identity function). These networks has a tight bottleneck of a few neurons in the middle, forcing them to create effective representations that compress the input into a low-dimensional code that can be used by the decoder to reproduce the original input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical autoencoder architecture comprises of three main components: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoding Architecture :** The encoder architecture comprises of series of layers with decreasing number of nodes and ultimately reduces to a latent view repersentation.  \n",
    "- **Latent View Repersentation :** Latent view repersents the lowest level space in which the inputs are reduced and information is preserved.  \n",
    "- **Decoding Architecture :** The decoding architecture is the mirro image of the encoding architecture but in which number of nodes in every layer increases and ultimately outputs the similar (almost) input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](**https://i.imgur.com/Rrmaise.png**)\n",
    "\n",
    "A highly fine tuned autoencoder model should be able to reconstruct the same input which was passed in the first layer. In this kernel, I will walk you through the working of autoencoders and their implementation.  Autoencoders are widly used with the image data and some of their use cases are: \n",

    "## How Autoencoders work \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind autoencoders is to learn a low level repersenation of a high level dimentional data. Lets try to understand the encoding process with an example.  Consider a data repersentation space (N dimentional space which is used to repersent the data) and consider the data points repersented by two variables : x1 and x2. Data Manifold is the space inside the data repersentation space in which the true data resides. "
